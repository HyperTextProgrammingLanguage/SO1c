Info about rewrite

The if statmen in normal text:
	Check if the car is too close to the one in front:
	    If the distance to the car ahead is less than the minimum safe distance, the car stops completely by setting its speed to zero.

	Check if the car is within the reaction distance and hasn't started reacting yet:
	    If the car is close enough to need a reaction and hasn't already started reacting (this.fare is false), it begins the reaction process.
	    It sets this.reaktion and this.fare to true and starts a timer.
	    If the car is moving faster than a certain speed (maxSpeed2), it slows down to that speed.

	Check if the reaction time has ended:
	    If the car is already reacting (this.reaktion is true) and the reaction time has passed, it stops reacting.

	If the car is still in a cautious state (this.fare is true):
	    If the distance to the car in front is greater than the reaction distance plus a buffer, the car gradually speeds up.
	    If it reaches the safe speed (maxSpeed2), it resumes normal driving and exits the cautious state (this.fare = false).
	    If the car gets too close again (distance is below reaction distance minus the buffer), it gradually slows down.
